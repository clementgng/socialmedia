This is a simple social media web app where people can register, create a profile, submit posts and comments for others to see

Heroku:
https://hidden-crag-14438.herokuapp.com/

I would recommend using my heroku deploy as this git repo has edits as I work on the app in my free time aside from work and online courses

#Install npm packages for the backend server

npm install

#Install npm packages for the frontend client

npm run client-install OR
cd client/ => npm install

#Run client(port 3000) and server(port 4000 by default) at the same time

npm run dev

#Run backend server

npm start

#Run frontend client

npm run client

At the moment, every user's profile picture is a picture of Rainn Wilson as Dwight Schrute from the American TV show, The Office

TODO in future when I have time:

Fix any bugs I find while playing around with the web app

Add edit button for editing a user's experience or education

Create like a comment feature

Create upload profile picture feature

Create a forgot password feature

In comments section of a post, add ability to go to a user's profile when clicking on their picture
